# AI Algorithms for stochastic model checking
This is part of my master's thesis at DTU.
This project includes PRISM and thus needs it set up (as specified on the official website https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/InstallingPRISM/Instructions).
The project includes a MDP generator, a Markov Chain generator and a Genetic Algorithm, this is all inside the thesis package. All the results from executions are stored in the results2 folder and all the MDPs used for these tests are in the examples directory. Nothing else beside these folders is my intellectual property.
